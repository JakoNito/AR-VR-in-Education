              <h4>
                Group Evaluation 
              </h4>
                Together as a group we learnt the benefits and negatives of simulation in the sector of education. We found the key issues to be those of costs, complexity, and regulations. For the benefits we learnt that availability, safety, and environmental benefits are present. The largest issue we faced as a group was the fact the approaching exams meant we were unable to meet in person, but we managed to counteract this issue and make it less prevalent as we were using multiple different forms of communication. We reacted to the issues well by being able to focus more time on our individual parts after our first exam. The best opportunity as a group was the fact, we all found a topic of interest to each of us. This helped keep the group motivated and on task. Another good opportunity for our group was seeking feedback from the teaching assistants and other students. To help improve the skills going forward I can say to myself I need to continue to work on my coding capabilities and academic writing skills. I feel as a group the workload was completed evenly and timely between all the members. Together as a group we worked well, we had effective communication even during a remarkably busy part of the year, we also worked well by giving each other feedback and helping where needed. To further better our assignment next time, I would personally suggest getting a better understanding of Rubick and what is expected of us during the assignment. I would also recommend more in-person meetings, but I understand the fact that everyone has exams currently. In conclusion, I am more than pleased with the amount of work the group has done as a whole and the quality of the work that was completed. Georgia did a great job of writing her half of the assignment and helping when we needed her too. Jan created a great-looking website and wrote a fantastic part on the technology used in these simulations.

              <h4>
                Ethical Issues: 
              </h4>
                Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) simulations in flight simulation and education is a growing field. With the quick growth of this field there have been questions behind the ethics. Firstly, simulations can be a cause of trainers to lose their jobs. With the ever-growing technology behind these simulations the need for people to help with these will be reduced as the software will know what to do. Also, if future / trainee pilots have only ever practiced and trained with these simulations, it could create a false sense of security in their actual ability. Flight simulations can also have adverse health effects. There have been studies where people can get damage such as eye strain from virtual reality due to extended periods of us. On the other hand, these simulations have helped decrease human error during flight. Simulations are also more sustainable with updates, then needing to purchase the latest plane for practice. Environmentally wise, the aviation industry is the leading transportation field for producing emissions. Using simulations to teach flying is a great sustainable and environmentally friendly way to help decrease these emissions. Simulations to help create new aircraft to prevent safety concerns when testing new planes, as these new aircraft can be simulated flying before ever being built (Allerton, 2009, p. 13) thus also helping with the environmental issues of running and building aircraft. To continue using VR and AR simulations in education it is important to understand that practice in these simulations does not always convert to real life skills and that there will always need to be an aspect of real-life training.
