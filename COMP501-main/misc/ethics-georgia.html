                Group Evaluation 
              </h4>
                <p>
                  Together as a group, we learned several valuable insights regarding the advantages of using flight simulators for training. We discovered that safety is the main advantage, as pilots can practice emergency landings and other tasks typically reserved for real flights during emergencies. Additionally, flight simulators offer year-round availability, unlike physical planes that may undergo maintenance or be affected by weather conditions. They are also more affordable and environmentally superior, allowing pilots to practice with a minimal carbon footprint. However, simulation sickness is a considerable issue, and recreating realistic motion cues poses a challenge. Furthermore, the low-stress environment in simulators can lead to a lack of motivation in trainees, which could be a significant mistake if they need to rely on those skills during a real flight. The architecture of flight simulators is complex and requires specialized knowledge for assembly, with strict regulations governing their requirements. Additionally, the aviation industry faces the risk of cyber-attacks that could damage both planes and simulators. We also noted the similarity in regulations between New Zealand and the United States, making changes to the machines difficult due to strict regulations. While the cost of a flight simulator is lower than that of a full plane, it still represents a significant expense for companies, including ongoing maintenance.

                  As a team, we encountered challenges in finding time to meet in person due to our individual exams and upcoming tests. To overcome this, we relied on emails and Discord as our primary means of communication. We scheduled online meetings to discuss the project and update each other on our progress. During lab sessions, we maximized our time by working together. Fortunately, each team member found an area of interest to write about, enabling us to provide valuable feedback to one another. The flexibility of communication platforms accessible on laptops and smartphones was beneficial, allowing us to easily seek opinions and help from team members. Tan made an exceptional website and provided insights on the technology used in flight simulators. Coby effectively highlighted the advantages of using simulators. Personally, I believe my academic writing and research skills improved throughout this project. If given the opportunity to do it again, I would prioritize more in-person meetings and rehearsal sessions for our presentations. However, considering the constraints of exams and tests, this may still pose challenges. It would have been helpful to have a clearer understanding of the assignment and scoring rubric from the start, reducing stress and facilitating the assignment creation process.

            <p>
              While simulators can be great tools for pilots and allow them to learn in a safe environment, they can also be used by terrorists. It is important that the simulations be as accurate as possible so that the pilots can use them to land at different airports around the world, and then be able to do it again in a real plane. This level of detail could easily be used to the advantage of terrorists(Sukhov, 2019).

              Desensitization 
            </p>
            <p>
              Significant efforts have been made to make flight simulators as realistic as possible to improve training. However, this can potentially lead to pilots or trainees may become desensitized to the potential consequences of their actions. Since simulators lack the physical risks and emotional intensity of real-life scenarios, individuals may underestimate the gravity of their decisions, potentially leading to complacency or a lack of respect for the inherent risks of flying (Sukhov, 2019).

              Emotional Distancing
            </p>
            <p>
              During a real flight, the pilot&#8217;s decisions can lead to life-or-death consequences. However, flight simulators often lack the emotional impact of real-world situations. This emotional detachment can make it challenging for pilots to fully comprehend the gravity of their decisions and the potential impact on passengers, crew, and the environment (Sukhov, 2019).

              Accessibility 
            </p>
            <p>
              Individual or regions with limited resources may not be able to access flight simulators due to the cost of purchasing and maintaining the simulator in the first place. Even if an individual lives close to a flight training facility, affording a single training session is still out of most individuals budgets. Because of this, inequalities in pilot training can exclude entire social economic groups(Sukhov, 2019).

              Environmental Impact
            </p>
            <p>
              Although flight simulators are significantly better for the environment than training pilots in real planes, they still use substantial amounts of energy. There also the environmental impact of  the machine&#8217;s materials, and longevity. Ensuring sustainable practices in simulator development and operation, such as ethical material sources, and energy- efficient designs are important to help further mitigate the carbon footprint (Sher, F., et al. 2021.)

              Privacy and Data Security 
            </p>
            <p>
              Personal details and performance reports are used and created in vast amounts during flight simulations. Ensuring the privacy and consent of pilots/trainees is safeguarded is essential. Flight simulation companies must adhere to stringent data protection protocols to prevent unauthorised access and maintenance of the secure system (Sukhov, 2019).
