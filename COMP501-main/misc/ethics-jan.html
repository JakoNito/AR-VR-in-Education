                Group Evaluation 
              </h4>
              Working with a group throughout this investigation has helped me define the importance of collaboration and communication. As a group, we made sure to consider each other&#8217;s different perspectives and make decisions as a group. Alongside this, we established each other's roles and individual responsibilities beforehand which helped us keep track of progression and evenly distribute the workload. In the beginning of the group assignment, we used communication apps to communicate with each other and help inform possible issues and questions. This ultimately helped us increase our productivity and get work done faster as opposed to trying to juggle all the workload myself. Furthermore, we also helped improve each other&#8217;s skills such as our decision-making, communication and problem-solving skills. Both my teammates were very efficient in completing and achieving their responsibilities of the assignment. Coby and Georgia engaged very frequently and wrote in-depth and remarkable investigations. They were also very keen on helping me during the website development. An issue we ran into however, was the difficulties aligning our schedules for online meetings, especially due to a heavy schedule with exams and assignments. As a result, we found ourselves each working on our parts or responding to each other at different times. For future reference, a way we can improve is making use of scheduling tools to help organize our time better. I would also suggest organizing more face-to-face meetings, which would improve the quality of our discussion and help us better understand our tasks.

                Ethical Issues: 
              </h4>
              Digital simulation in aviation shows significant benefits in impacting the aviation industry. The use of simulative technology such as A.R. and V.R. technology has especially shown promise within its immersive abilities. However, with this may also bring ethical and health concerns that need to be considered before its implementation into society. The first issue is that although immersive technology shows efficacy in flight training, it still cannot yet be considered a complete alternative, to conventional flight training. Lack of motivation is an issue faced within current simulative training options. Simulation training tends to give users a misconceived perception of danger, therefore being more likely to take risker decisions. Immersive and non-immersive simulation training will always be incomparable to real flight due to its significantly lower stress levels. Moreover, the immersive nature of these flight simulators can bring health risks such as psychological distress. A study by Saastamoinen, K. (2021), identifies symptoms such as nausea within its use. For future implications, the wellbeing of the user must be prioritised and these risks are considered to ensure that this technology is optimised and can provide a safer experience. In contrast, simulative technology can also benefit and transform the training options in the aviation industry. Simulative training offers a safe and remote means of training. Not only does this significantly reduce the risks and potential accidents that may occur in conventional training, but it will also give trainees the opportunity to prepare for emergencies and scenarios where training is not available. Furthermore, this combats existing issues such as cost and environmental risks. Remote and easily accessible training will eliminate the issue of operating and maintenance costs of a real aircraft. In terms of its environmental impact, currently, the aviation industry is one the biggest contributors to carbon emissions and global warming as per Sher, F., et al. (2021). The result in reducing the need to train in real aircrafts will significantly reduce the total carbon emissions produced each year. The implementation of using Simulative technology in the aviation industry altogether provide a numerous amount of societal and ethical benefits, however potential drawbacks such as health risk must be carefully considered to ensure the safety and well-being of users.
